This is a solution to a big problem I come up with when I use PowerShell which is quite simple.
> I want to delete files, but I always have to add all these parameters, which can take up to 5 minutes sometimes.

# Functionality
Right now, I have four basic functions:

- Creating folders & files
- Deleting folders & files
- Moving folders & files
- Copying folders & files
- Renaming folders & files
